# Madness

You shouldn't be reading this part.  There isn't any interesting text here.  It's just a space for your eyes to keep searching for meaning when there is none.

# Experiments

This project is the playful playground of experiments. There are many paths ahead of us, but we have but two feet.

# TODO

Need a better intermediate format.  Preferably something we can convert to post function processing that will help us quickly do a type/lifetime test.
